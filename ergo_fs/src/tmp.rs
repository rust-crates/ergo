/// A `PathDir` that is automatically deleted when it goes out of scope.
///
/// > **Unlike the other `Path` types, this type is not cloneable.**
///
/// The [`PathTmp`] type creates a directory on the file system that is deleted once it goes out of
/// scope. At construction, the `PathTmp` creates a new directory with a randomly generated name,
/// and with a prefix of your choosing.
///
/// The default constructor, [`PathTmp::create`], creates directories in the location returned by
/// [`std::env::temp_dir()`], but `PathTmp` can be configured to manage a temporary directory in
/// any location by constructing with [`PathTmp::create_in`].
///
/// After creating a `PathTmp`, work with the file system by doing standard [`std::fs`] file system
/// operations on its [`Path`], which can be retrieved with [`PathTmp::path`]. Once the `PathTmp`
/// value is dropped, the directory at the path will be deleted, along with any files and
/// directories it contains. It is your responsibility to ensure that no further file system
/// operations are attempted inside the temporary directory once it has been deleted.
///
/// Various platform-specific conditions may cause `PathTmp` to fail to delete the underlying
/// directory. It's important to ensure that handles (like [`File`] and [`ReadDir`]) to files
/// inside the directory are dropped before the `PathTmp` goes out of scope. The `PathTmp`
/// destructor will silently ignore any errors in deleting the directory; to instead handle errors
/// call [`PathTmp::close`].
///
/// Note that if the program exits before the `PathTmp` destructor is run, such as via
/// [`std::process::exit`], by segfaulting, or by receiving a signal like `SIGINT`, then the
/// temporary directory will not be deleted.
